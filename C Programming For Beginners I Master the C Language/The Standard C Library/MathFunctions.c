    Math functions

    -to use common math functions you must include the math.h header file and link to the math library

    -double acosh(x)
        -returns the hyperbolic arccosine of x,x>=1

    -double asin(x)
        -returns the arcsine of x as an angle expressed in radians in the range [-pi/2, pi/2]. x is in the range [-1,1]

    -double atan(x)
        -returns the arctangent of x as an angle expressed in radians in the range [-pi/2, pi/2]

    -double ceil(x)
        -returns the smallest integer value greather than or equal to x.Note that the value is returned as a double

    -double cos(r)
        -returns the cosine of r

    -double floor(x)
        -returns the largest integer value less than or equal to x. Note that the value is returned as a double
    
    -double log(x)
        -returns the natural logarithm of x, x>=0

    -double nan(s)
        -returns a NaN, is possible, according to the content specified by the string pointed to by s
    
    -double pow (x,y)
        -returns xy. If x is less than zero, y must be an integer. If x is equal to zero, y must be greater than zero

    -double remainder(x,y)
        -returns the remainder of x divided by y

    -double round(x)
        -returns the value of x rounded to the nearest integer in floating-point format. Halfway values are always rounded away from zero (so 0.5 always rounds to 1.0)

    -double sin(r)
        -returns the sine of r
    
    -double sqrt(x)
        -returns the square root of x, x>=0

    -double tan(r)
        -returns the tangent of r
    
    -And so many more ...
        -complex arithmetic
