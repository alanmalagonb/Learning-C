            -it outputs information to the command line (the standard output stream, which is the command line by default)
            -the information displayed is in based on what appear between the parentheses that immediately follow the function name (printf)
            -also notice that this line does end with a semicolon
        -probably the most common functions used in C
        -provides an easy and convenient means to display program results
        -not only can simple phrases be displayed, but the values of variables and the results of computations can also be displayed
            -used for debugging
