/*
    Preprocessor
    -Another unique feature of the C language that is not found in many other higher-level programming languages.
    -Allows for programs to be easier to develop, easier to red, easier to modify, and easier to port to different computer systems.
    -Part of the C compilation process that recognizes special statements
        -Analyzes these statement before analysis of the C program itself takes place
        -An instruction to your compiler to do something before compiling the source code
        -Could be anywhere in your code
    -Preprocessor statements are identified by the presence of a pound sign, #, which must be the first non-space character on the line

    Applications
    -Create are own constants and macros with the #define statement
    -Build your own library files with the #include statement
    -Make more powerful programs with the conditional #ifdef, #endif, #else, and #ifndef statements
